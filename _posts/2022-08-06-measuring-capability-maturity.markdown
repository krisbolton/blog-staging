I often have the need to explain the current maturity of a particular capability, function, or process, in the context of describing the current state versus the desired state and how we get to the desired state. Be it part of a data protection programme, IT incident response process, or something else. 

Clearly articulating the current position versus the desired position of a capability is integral to obtaining stakeholder understanding and approval for a desired change.

I've found myself using the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) a number of times this year to improve reader understanding of the desired effect in documentation I'm writing.

## Capability Maturity Model

The Capability Maturity Model was originally created by Humphrey Watts to describe software capability maturity in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/52.2014" target="_blank">March 1988 issue of IEEE Software</a>. However, it can be used to describe the maturity of any process.

The Model describes 5 levels of maturity, from ad-hoc to optimised. The table below describes each level: 

<table class="styled-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Maturity level</th>
            <th>Dscription</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Initial <br/>(Ad-hoc)</td>
            <td>Actions are conducted on an ad-hoc basis. Actions undocumented and mostly reactionary. Processes are highly dependent on key individuals who know how to act.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Repeatable <br/>(Developing)</td>
            <td>The basic elements of the process are documented to a sufficient degree to allow repetition of certain actions. Documentation is incomplete or incorrect.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Defined</td>
            <td>The process is defined as a standardised set of actions, typically aligned to known best practice or standards.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Managed <br/>(Capable)</td>
            <td>The process utilises agreed metrics to increase the performance of the process over time and reports in a structured manner. Decisions are defined by process.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Optimised <br/>(Efficient)</td>
            <td>The process is efficiently managed to a degree allowing continual improvement and may act as a competitive advantage.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Using the Model

Primarily, I use the levels as a conceptual model along side a plan to show how a certain change, or set of changes, provide a benefit to the organisation or programme. 

Showing how <i>change A</i> to <i>process B</i>, which is currently in an immature state (e.g., <i>developing</i>), and the expected level is <i>defined</i>, will improve <i>process B</i> to the desired level over X period is an incredibly useful tool.

Typically, shown as a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-flow-chart-with-smartart-30f87402-ba3d-48c8-8e9f-a66bcee7e5aa" target="_blank">process flow diagram in Word</a> (rather than a table), it aids visual learners and allows readers to more easily absorb the effect of your proposal.

Capabilities mapped against the Model don't need to neatly fit into a specific level. It is possible to describe your capability as in between two levels. It's often the case you will describe something as moving between <i>developing</i> and <i>defined</i>, for example, and go on to state what actions need to be completed for the capability to be considered <i>defined</i>.
