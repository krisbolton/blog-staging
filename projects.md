## Security Kiwi (https://security.kiwi)

<a href="https://security.kiwi" target="_blank">Security Kiwi</a> is an <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/" target="_blank">Flask</a> web application I created to host free courses which I make relating to information security. Currently, the primary material on Security Kiwi is a course introducing readers to machine learning for security. It teaches how to collect, clean and prepare suitable data, and several chapters introduction to basic machine learning methods and techniques.
