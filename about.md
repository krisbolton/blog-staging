# About

<b>Hello there, I'm Kris.</b> I work in data protection and information security in the UK.

I use this website to share the knowledge and experience I have gained through my work, education and personal projects. 

I'm passionate about information security, both the technical side and GRC side, in which I work. I use personal projects to retain and improve my technical skills and knowledge. 

I run <a href="https://security.kiwi">Security Kiwi</a>, a free website of courses containing the knowledge I gained through degrees and from my own learning.

You can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/krisbolton">@KrisBolton<a/>.
